**Which language have you translated?**
e.g Russian

**Please link to the GitHub pull request where you have submitted translations**
e.g I have submitted translations for the GrapheneOS Camera app at https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Camera/pull/1337

**Have you ensured that all translations are taking into account context within the app and where they are displayed?**
e.g Does this phrase make sense in all areas where it is used within the app?
