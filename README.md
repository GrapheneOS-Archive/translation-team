# Want to get involved with translating GrapheneOS? This is the place to be.

## Overview

Currently GrapheneOS is looking for community members who are able to translate and peer review others work. 

Within scope are the following subprojects:

https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Auditor

https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Apps

https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Camera

https://github.com/GrapheneOS/PDFViewer

## Guidance

Not all translations are simple, and some must be able to convey technical intricacy towards users who lack context. 
Ensure that translations are done taking note of context and ensuring that they make sense throughout an app. We strongly
suggest all members to subscribe to this repo by "watching" it so that they can always jump in to aid with translations.

GrapheneOS projects typically follow a rapid development cycle and so translations are often needed and ideally we want
to aim to get them done in a timely fashion. We have a reasonable expectation that members are able to to assist with
translations on an as-needed basis.
